# VBA Stock Market Analysis Project
This project involves creating a VBA script to analyze stock market data across multiple worksheets (quarters) in an Excel workbook. The script automates repetitive tasks, calculates essential stock metrics, applies conditional formatting, and delivers insights into stock performance.

**Data Retrieval and Processing:**

Successfully loops through all rows of data for each quarter.
Extracts and stores key information, including:
Ticker Symbol: Unique identifier for each stock.
Quarterly Volume: Total stock volume for each ticker.
Opening Price: The price at the start of the quarter.
Closing Price: The price at the end of the quarter.
Calculated Metrics:

**Computes the following for each stock:**
Quarterly Change ($): Difference between the closing and opening prices.
Percentage Change (%): Relative change in price during the quarter.
Identifies stocks with:
Greatest % Increase.
Greatest % Decrease.
Greatest Total Volume.
Output Organization:

**Adds new columns for calculated metrics and outputs them in a clear format:**
Ticker Symbol.
Total Stock Volume.
Quarterly Change ($).
Percent Change (%).
Conditional Formatting:

**Applies color coding to emphasize performance:**
Green for positive changes in quarterly performance.
Red for negative changes.
Automation Across Worksheets:
The script is capable of processing all worksheets in the workbook, ensuring consistency and scalability.

Performance Optimization:
Tested the script using a smaller dataset (alphabetical_testing.xlsx) for faster iteration and debugging.
Optimized to process large datasets efficiently.

Repository includes:
VBA script files for each analysis.
Screenshots of the results showcasing functionality and formatting.
A comprehensive README file documenting the project and instructions.

**Project Achievements**
Automated Analysis: The script eliminates manual calculations and formatting, streamlining the analysis of stock data for multiple quarters.
Clear Visualization: Conditional formatting enhances data readability and highlights critical insights.
Scalability: The solution handles datasets of varying sizes and structures, demonstrating adaptability and reliability.
Professional Documentation: Code and results are well-documented and uploaded to GitHub for review and collaboration.

**Conclusion**
The VBA Stock Market Analysis project successfully achieves the goal of automating the processing and analysis of stock data. By integrating dynamic calculations, conditional formatting, and multi-sheet functionality, the script provides a robust tool for financial data analysis. This project highlights the power of VBA in Excel for repetitive tasks and data-driven decision-making.
